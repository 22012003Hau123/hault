Google is phasing out **Chrome Apps** on Chrome OS. The OptiSigns Chrome App (available in the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/optisigns-digital-signage/ankpffnbahhgegojammhgdnbmdbfnnfe)) is affected by this change and may no longer run on certain Chrome OS versions.

If your Chrome OS device can no longer run the OptiSigns Chrome App, you can still use OptiSigns by downloading our app from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.optisigns.playe1&hl=en-US), or our **Android APK** version directly from our [website](https://download.optisignsapp.com/Android/optisigns_googleVersion_release_latest_stable.apk). The latter option requires access to Developer Mode.

According to [Google’s official statement](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/15950395?sjid=12937841724344377860-NC):

* **July 2025 (ChromeOS M138)** – Last release supporting **user-installed Chrome Apps** (like the OptiSigns Chrome App).

* **February 2028 (ChromeOS M168)** – Final end of **all Chrome Apps**. LTS devices supported until October 2028.

## **Who Is Affected**

You may be affected if:

* You use the **OptiSigns Chrome App** on Chrome OS.
* Your device has updated beyond **ChromeOS M138** for regular installs, or beyond **M150** for kiosk mode.
* The app fails to launch, shows “App not supported,” or no longer appears in your app list.

**Check your Chrome OS version:**

1. Go to **Settings → About Chrome OS**.
2. Note your version and channel (Stable, Beta, Dev, LTS, LTC).

## **Workaround: Download from the Google Play Store, or Use the OptiSigns Android App (APK)**

Downloading the app from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.optisigns.playe1&hl=en-US) is the easiest way. However, we have tested and confirmed that the OptiSigns Android APK works on Chrome OS devices even when the Chrome App no longer runs.

**How to Install the APK:**

1. **Download the APK**  
   - Go to the official OptiSigns [website](https://www.optisigns.com/download) and download the latest [Android APK](https://download.optisignsapp.com/Android/optisigns_googleVersion_release_latest_stable.apk).
2. **Enable “Unknown Sources”**
   1. Go to **Settings → Security & Privacy → Install unknown apps**.
   2. Allow installation from your browser or file manager.
3. **Install the APK**
   1. Open the downloaded APK in the Files app.
   2. Follow prompts to install.
4. **Launch OptiSigns**
   1. Find it in your launcher, sign in, and start using your displays.

Note that to run the APK, you will need access to [**Developer Mode**](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options).

## **Recommendations**

* If you still need kiosk mode, use the APK in combination with Chrome OS kiosk settings (if supported by your device).
* Keep Chrome OS updated to the latest version your device supports.
* For long-term deployments, consider switching to a fully supported [Android](https://www.optisigns.com/product/hardware) or [Pro/ProMax](https://www.optisigns.com/product/hardware) player.
